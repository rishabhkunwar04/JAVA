* The Observer design pattern is a behavioral design pattern, used to create a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. In this blog post, we will delve into the Observer design pattern, explore its components, and implement Stock Market Monitoring.

##### Components of the Observer Design Pattern
* Subject: The subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them of state changes.
* Observer: The observer interface defines the contract for concrete observer classes.
* ConcreteSubject: A class that implements the subject interface and manages the observers.
* ConcreteObserver: A class that implements the observer interface and receives notifications.
