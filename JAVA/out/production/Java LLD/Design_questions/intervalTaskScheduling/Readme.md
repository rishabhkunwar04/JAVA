### Interval Task Scheduling:
* In this problem, candidates are given tasks with start and end times and priorities. They must select non-overlapping tasks with the highest combined priority, using efficient algorithms to optimize task selection. This assesses skills in handling scheduling constraints and managing multiple data structure
