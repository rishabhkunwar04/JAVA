/*
Abstract Factory Pattern
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides a way to create families of related or dependent objects without
specifying their concrete classes. Unlike the Factory Pattern, which uses one method to create objects,
the Abstract Factory Pattern uses multiple factories to create related objects.

Purpose
Used when you need to create families of related objects with varying implementations.
