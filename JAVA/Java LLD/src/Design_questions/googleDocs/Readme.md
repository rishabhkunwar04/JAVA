------------------------ 
1. users can create, read, and update, rename, and delete ,manage documents with content.
2. Initially, documents are private, but owners can grant others permissions to view or edit them
3. owner can also revoke access.

This question assesses an understanding of access control and handling of user permissions through object-oriented principle
